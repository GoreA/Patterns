# Patterns

This project was created just in educational scope.
It is used to explain when and how the code patterns can be used. The examples are based on GoT serial that is very famous among my students. 
Patterns presented here:
  * adapter

  * iterator
  * observer
  * proxy/protect
  * singletone
